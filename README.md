<h1>Tell Me</h1>
<p>Tell Me is a simple to-do web application that uses mean to let the user create a to-do list. Tell Me features a login functionality and a ranking system. <br>
the ranking system allows users to rank their to-do to their specefic needs. If one need requires greater attention, the user can rank that task to the top.</p>

For the MVP: We worked on the files in "basic ToDo" together on my laptop along with attempt to set up a mean.io project and committed and pushed them on my laptop due to complications on Laura's laptop
